Hey there! I'm Hari from Bangalore, India and currently a graduate student in computer science living in Dallas.

My aim is to learn programming the way Peter Norvig describes in his [article](http://norvig.com/21-days.html).

My graduate coursework is in the systems area ( distributed systems, concurrent programming, computer architecture etc )

I was a software engineer for around 3 years building content management systems in the Java domain.
